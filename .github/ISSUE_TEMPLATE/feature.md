name: ðŸš€ Feature
about: RFC and ideas for new features and improvements
labels: kind/enhancement, need triage

---

### Summary
<!-- One paragraph explanation of the feature. -->

### Motivation
<!-- Explain why this is relevant to you. Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? -->

### Examples
<!-- A simple example of the new feature in action
     If the new feature changes an existing feature, include a simple before/after comparison. -->

### Future possibilities
<!-- Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project and language in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project and of the relevant sub-team. -->

<!-- This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related. -->
<!-- If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything. -->

<!-- Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information. -->
